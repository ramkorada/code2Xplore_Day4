Course Code: CSE205
University: SRM University–AP
Concerned Teacher: Dr. Yasir Afaq

Problem Description

This program works on a list that contains both numbers and strings. The goal is to separate numbers and strings into two different lists using a for loop and conditional statements. Empty strings are ignored while processing the data. A personalization rule is applied to make the output unique for each student.

Logic Used

User input is taken as a single line and split into a list

A for loop checks each element one by one

Numbers are stored in a number list

Strings are stored in a string list

Empty strings are ignored

Total count of numbers and strings is calculated

Personalization Applied

Option B – Name Length Logic

Name used: Abhiram

Name length is odd

Hence, the last element is removed from both the number list and the string list

Constraints Followed

Used list data structure

Used for loop

Used conditional statements

Did not use append(), pop(), isdigit()

Did not use list comprehension, filter(), or map()

Sample Input
10 Python 25 Loop 40

Sample Output
Numbers List: [10, 25]
Strings List: [Python]
Total Numbers: 3
Total Strings: 2

Learning Outcome

This challenge helped me understand how to use for loops and if-else conditions in Python. I learned how to separate data based on type and apply my own logic to modify the output. It improved my basic programming and logical thinking skills.
